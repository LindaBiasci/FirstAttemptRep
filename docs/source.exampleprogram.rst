Source: exampleprogram
======================

As suggested by the name, ``exampleprogram.py`` is just an example. Actually, 
this repository's only purpose is allowing me to practice. 

The program converts a given acoustic intensity to its equivalent sound level 
(it's basically the definition of dB). Its correspondent test, ``test_exampleprogram.py``, 
and some static code analysis guarantee ``exampleprogram.py`` is working as it should.
